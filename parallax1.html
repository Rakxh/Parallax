  <h2 class="secHeading">Adventure Time!</h2>
  <p class="text">
    Adventurous experiences create psychological arousal,which can be interpreted as negative (e.g. fear) or positive (e.g. flow). For some people, adventure becomes a major pursuit in and of itself. According to adventurer André Malraux, in his Man's Fate (1933), "If a man is not ready to risk his life, where is his dignity?"

    Similarly, Helen Keller stated that "Life is either a daring adventure or nothing."
<br>
<br>
Outdoor adventurous activities are typically undertaken for the purposes of recreation or excitement: examples are adventure racing and adventure tourism. Adventurous activities can also lead to gains in knowledge, such as those undertaken by explorers and pioneers – the British adventurer Jason Lewis, for example, uses adventures to draw global sustainability lessons from living within finite environmental constraints on expeditions to share with schoolchildren. Adventure education intentionally uses challenging experiences for learning.

    <h2 class="desc">BIKING</h2>
  </div>
  <p class="text">
    Biking is a top-notch cardio workout. You'll burn about 400 calories an hour. Plus it strengthens your lower body, including your legs, hips, and glutes. If you want a workout that's gentle on your back, hips, knees, and ankles, this is a great choice. You can cycle on the road, a bike path, or a mountain trail.
   <br>
   <br>
   Mountain biking is trickier because you have to navigate hills and surfaces, so your upper body and core will kick into gear. It’s more of a total-body workout than biking on the road, which is mostly a lower-body cardio workout.

    Plan to get on your bike and ride for 30-60 minutes, 3-5 days a week.</p>

    <h2 class="desc">PARA GLIDING</h2>
  </div>
  <p class="text">
    Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure.[1] The pilot sits in a harness or in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside.
    <br>
    <br>
    Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to five hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height, often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres.

    <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
  </div>
  <p class="text">
    Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.
    <br>
    <br>
    The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. There are several types of boards. The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft.
